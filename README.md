# FDR (Fitness Diet Recommendation)
The "Fitness Diet Calculator" is a web tool for personalized diet recommendations based on user age, weight, height, and gender. Users can choose between "Gain" and "Loss" options, with separate pages for each. Stylish CSS and a background image improve the user interface.
The project's main features include:

1. **Background Image:** The webpage features an appealing background image that enhances the user experience.

2. **Navigation Buttons:** Two prominent buttons, "Gain" and "Loss," are located at the top of the page. These buttons allow users to choose their fitness goals, whether it's gaining or losing weight.

3. **Gain Button:** Clicking the "Gain" button navigates the user to a separate "gain.jsp" page where they can find dietary recommendations for gaining weight.

4. **Loss Button:** Clicking the "Loss" button reloads the current page, enabling users to access dietary recommendations for losing weight on the same page.

5. **User Input Form:** The main section of the page includes a user input form where individuals can enter their age, weight, height, and select their gender.

6. **CSS Styling:** The project incorporates CSS styles to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, with a stylish header and well-designed buttons.

The project aims to provide tailored dietary guidance to users, offering them a clear path to achieve their fitness goals, whether it's gaining or losing weight.
