# FDR (Fitness Diet Recommendation)
**Project Overview: Fitness Diet Calculator(Recommendation)**

The Fitness Diet Calculator is a web-based application designed to help individuals, especially those in the age range of 20 to 50, calculate their dietary recommendations based on age, weight, height, and gender. The project consists of an HTML form for user input, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file to handle the calculation and display of diet recommendations.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Input Form:** The application provides a user-friendly form where individuals can enter their age, weight, height, and select their gender.

2. **Validation:** Input fields are validated to ensure that values fall within the specified ranges (e.g., age between 20 and 50, weight between 80 and 100 kg, height between 4.5 and 6.0 feet).

3. **Calculate Diet Button:** Users can click the "Calculate Diet" button to trigger the diet recommendation calculation.

4. **Dynamic Output:** Upon clicking the button, the JavaScript code calculates the dietary recommendations based on the provided information.

5. **Diet Recommendations:** Recommendations are displayed in a designated area on the web page. These recommendations vary according to the user's age, weight, height, and gender.

6. **Background Image:** The web page features an attractive background image for aesthetics.

7. **Gain and Loss Buttons:** The project also includes "Gain" and "Loss" buttons at the top of the page. Clicking the "Loss" button reloads the same page, while clicking the "Gain" button navigates to another page, potentially with information related to gaining fitness.

This project serves as a useful tool for individuals seeking personalized diet recommendations tailored to their age, weight, height, and gender. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface while promoting a healthy lifestyle.
